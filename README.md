# FIPT: Fast impedance tortuosity 

FIPT is a measurement technique that allows a fast determination of the ionic resistance for battery electrodes. The technique is based on the work by J. Landesfeind (Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 163 (7) A1373-A1387 (2016) A1373) and then optimized for execution speed by D. Bozyigit at Battrion.

The measurement setup can be built based on https://github.com/deniz195/fipt 

Once data has been aquired, this repository provides the data analysis and model fitting. 



## Quick installation
To install the fipt-analysis, simply:

```bash
pip install fipt
```

## Requirements
Required packages are `numpy`, `scipy` for data and statistical models and `lmfit` to perform the model fitting.

It is recommended (but not necessary) to install matplotlib installed, so that fipt-analysis will be able to create plots of the fitting.









 is a Python library for dealing with data objects which describe physical objects with units and easy serialization. Let's look at an example. First, import unitdoc and create the registry that you will use in your application:
```python
from unitdoc import UnitDocRegistry

udr = UnitDocRegistry()
```

Let's create a class that represents a battery
```python
import attr

@udr.serialize()   
@attr.s()
class Battery(object):
    name = attr.ib()

    weight = udr.attrib(default='45g')
    volume = udr.attrib(default='16ml', default_unit='ml')
    capacity = udr.attrib(default='3.0Ah')
    voltage = udr.attrib(default='3.6V', description ='Average voltage')
```

We can create an instance of `Battery`, which will be a normal `attr` object (see [attrs library](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs)), which features e.g. a nice `repr` function:
```python
a_battery = Battery(name = 'battery', weight='43g')
print(a_battery)
# outputs: Battery(name='battery', weight=<Quantity(43, 'gram')>, volume=<Quantity(16, 'milliliter')>, capacity=<Quantity(3.0, 'Ah')>, voltage=<Quantity(3.6, 'volt')>)
```


We can use the attributes of the battery in any operation that are allowed by the pint package:
```python
energy = (a_battery.capacity * a_battery.voltage).to('Wh')
energy_density = (energy / a_battery.weight).to('Wh/kg')
print(f'{energy} @  {energy_density}')
# outputs: 10.8 Wh @  251.2 Wh / kg
```

Now let's save and reload our battery object:
```python
# look at serialized form
print(a_battery.serialize())

# outputs:
name: battery
weight: !unit 43 g
volume: !unit 16 ml
capacity: !unit 3 Ah
voltage: !unit 3.6 V
```

This can be easily saved to a file and reloaded again:
```python
fn = 'a_battery.yaml'
# save to yaml file
with open(fn, 'w') as f:
    f.write(a_battery.serialize())

# load from yaml file
with open(fn, 'r') as f:
    a_loaded_battery = Battery.deserialize(f.read())

assert a_battery == a_loaded_battery    
```

## More features
Unitdoc facilitates certain operations, which can improve your code. 

If you specify `default_unit` in an attribute, quantities are automatically normalized to that unit:
```python
a_battery = Battery(name = 'battery', volume='15903 mm^3')
print(a_battery.volume)
# outputs: 15.9 ml
```

If a `default_unit` is specified, any incompatible unit will raise an exception:
```python
from unitdoc import DimensionalityError

try:
    a_battery = Battery(name = 'battery', volume='42 g')
except DimensionalityError as e:
    print(e)
# outputs: Cannot convert from 'gram' ([mass]) to 'milliliter' ([length] ** 3)
```

You can retrieve description of parameters, for e.g. data representation code
```python
from unitdoc import get_attr_description
print(get_attr_description(a_battery.__class__, 'voltage'))
# outputs: Average voltage
```



## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install unitdoc:

```bash
pip install unitdoc
```

Alternatively, install the latest version from git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deniz195/unitdoc
python unitdoc/setup.py install --user
```

## Related packages
Unitdoc is based on the following amazing packages:

- [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/) deals with the units
- [ruamel.yamls](https://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) deals with (de)serializing from semi-structured data (nested dictionaries)
- [attrs](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs) deals with the boilerplate of data classes
- [cattr](https://github.com/Tinche/cattrs) deals with the unstructuring and restructuring of classes for (de)serialization

The UnitDocRegistry creates registries/converters/parsers for each package and aggregates them. You can leverage the features of each package:

Use unit registry from pint:
```python
q = udr.ureg('1000gram').to('kg')
print(q)
# outputs: 1 kg
```

Use yaml parser from ruaml.yaml:
```python
q_yaml = udr.yaml.dump(dict(weight=q))
print(q_yaml)
# outputs: weight: !unit 1 kg
```

Use cattr converter:
```python
@udr.serialize()   
@attr.s()
class Thing(object):
    weight = udr.attrib(default='45g', description ='Total weight')

a_thing = Thing()
a_thing_dict = udr.cattr.unstructure(a_thing)

assert type(a_thing_dict) == dict
print(a_thing_dict['weight'])
# output: 45 g
```

## Restrictions
Given the restrictions of the attrs package, updating attributes safely requires certain precautions. E.g. given the `Battery` class from above the following is possible but not desirable
```python
a_battery = Battery(name = 'battery')
a_battery.volume = 99
type(a_battery.volume)
# outputs: int
```
This is not desirable, because unit check and normalizatin is not performed. 

An good way to avoid this (and other problems) is to use keyword only (`kw_only=True`) and frozen (`frozen=True`) `attr` objects. 
```python
@udr.serialize()   
@attr.s(kw_only=True, frozen=True)
class BetterBattery(object):
    name = attr.ib()

    weight = udr.attrib(default='45g')
    volume = udr.attrib(default='16ml', default_unit='ml')
    capacity = udr.attrib(default='3.0Ah')
    voltage = udr.attrib(default='3.6V', description ='Average voltage')
```

The keyword only restriction, will not allow the creation of objects from positional parameters, so that the following line fails with a Type error:
```python
a_battery = BetterBattery('battery', '42g', '16ml') 
```
This is good, because positional arguments can be dangerous when data model changes over time. The following line creates a new object and is stable if the class changes
```python
a_battery = BetterBattery(name='battery', weight='42g', volume='16ml') 
```

The frozen instance restriction does not allow to mutate an object, so that this line will fail with a `FrozenInstanceError`
```python
a_battery.volume = 99 
```
To update values, you can use the attr.evolve function, which creates a new object with the updated value
```python
a_battery = attr.evolve(a_battery, volume='12cm^3')
```
In this case unit conversion and checks are performed as expected.

While unitdoc works with regular `attr` classes (`@attr.s()`), we strongly recommend using `@attr.s(kw_only=True, frozen=True)`.
